# Day 40 of 100 Day Code 

## JS 

Javascript functions**

Started my JavaScript functions and updated the loops section on my Day 5 of JavaScript coding 

Looking forward to continuing on my days.

## ALX

Introduction to Import modules and Data Structures in Python in ALX.
The tasks were a bit challenging but I managed to get through them to completion with the help of my friends and my peers

## Elsewhere

Started a PushMeHarder challenge on HackerRank to help me with my JS journey. 

Been long since Java so drafting a new timetable covering all the languages I am currently studying to make sure that I have grasp of each content and understand the logic of each and every language.

The day ended with an introduction to functions in JS.
