# Day 7 of 100 Days of Code

## Java Programming

Today I am taking part in Access Modifiers and more about the Java classes.

Earlier we had brushed through Access Modifiers in Java which include the following.
- Public
- Protected
- Private

These allow for the variables, methods and classess to be accessed in particular places in the code, be it in the package, class defined or otherwise.

Since I previously learnt about them, I am going to write a code showing the use of access modifiers in Java.

```Java
public class Modifiers{
    //this makes the class accessible throughout the package

    private int age;
    // the age will only be accessible in this class

    protected int account;
    // it makes the member visible to the package within which it is defined and to subclasses of the class within which it is defined that could be in any other package
    public static void main(String []args){
        //this is the main method accessible throughout the class
    }
}
```

There is nothing more to broaden on access modifiers being they are too short 

### Classes 

These are logical templates tp create objects that share common properties and methods.

In real world examples or application a cat is of the cats class 

## Python Programming 

Following my HackerRank challenge, 30 Days Challenge, there was a task on linked lists and I had no better clearing and understanding of the concept so I decided to study Data Structure and Algorithms in Python.

Started with the exact concept linked lists but time couldn't allow me to do it.

Hit pause and I will get on it the next day.

Though I managed to grasp a few concepts not enough to perform a task but I am someplace üëç
