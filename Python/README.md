# Python Programming

All about python programming

Using A tutorial in YoutTube and Challenges in HackerRank, I had me go under a sess with OOP in Python using David J Malaan CS50 Lectures. 

Concepts Learned 
- Object Creation 
- Class creation
- Inheritance

Since these concepts are explained in the earlier lessons on Java had need not explain the concepts again.

The codes I had myself practice are;
[Student CLass](./student.py)

[Showing inheritance](./person.py)
