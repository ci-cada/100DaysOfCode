## Characteristics of Java 
 - Object oriented 
 - Distributed 
 - Simple 
 - Secure 
 - Portable 

Being a highly portable and independent program Java is a High level programming language used in the development of Games, Desktop applications and Mobile Application(Android).

It has similiarities with languages such as JavaScript since they both are used on the clien server, they are subject to security restrictions and run on nearly every computer, and invoked from a web page.

Also it has similar characteristics with C++ since they share the same syntax and they are both object oriented.

## Object oriented concepts

Took a peek through some of the object oriented concepts and most used terms
 ### Object 
  This is a bundle of related variables and methods. They are often used to model real-world objects you find in every day life, i.e. Cars etc
 ### Encapsulation
  This is packaging an object within the protective custody of its methods. This helps in Modulation meaning, the code can be easily passed around in teh system. Giving a pen to someone. Information hiding meaning, the object can have a public interface where other ovjects can communicate with. You don't need to understand the engine of a car to drive it.
 ### Inheritance 
  Ability of a class get or acquire the characteristics or properties of another class. Inheritance helps in code reuse and defining the behavoiur using an abstract class
 ### Interface 
  A collection of unimplemented methods and data items, being different from the one used in GUI, it refers to a list of public methods provided in a class. They are usefull in; 
                - Capturing similarities among unrelated classes 
                - Declaring methods that one or more classes are expected to implement
                - Reveals an object's programming interface without the class 

 ### Tasks 
  Definition of;
  - Method - function related to an object states the behaviours and the characteristics of an object
  - Polymorphism - This is the taking of more than one form of a method 
  - Abstraction - Hiding of the implementation details of a certain code only providing the information needed by the user.
  - Aggregation - The ability of a class to have an entituy reference
  - Containers - A component that holds and manages other components

## Python 
HackerRank 30 days Challenge Coding.
Did some tasks on HackerRank gaining my first start for completing two challenges in a Day. 

The challlenges involved various object oriented concepts in python, which spearheaded my skills in Python programming following teh previous 30DayOfPython by Asabeneh.
