# Day 14 of 100 days of Code (Junk Files)

This is a folder containing codes in Java from an online test. 

Couldn't have a better name for it than Junk Files. 

Theoritical Tasks I will display them as text while the practical as program files.

## Tasks 

- Explain the following features of the Java programming language
   - Portability: They can run on multiple systems once written
   - Security: It cintains in built systems that ensure no code is easy to tamper with 

- Using examples define the following terms. 
    - Variable: The name of a particular memory than stores specific type of data.
    - Identifier: This is a name that identifies either a unique object or a unique classs of objects.
    - Data Type: This is what allows a variable to store specific type of values.

- Write a Java program requesting the radius of a circle and then calculates and prints out the area and circumference.

[Cicrcle](./Circle.java)

- Describe three properties of constructors
    - They have the same name as the class 
    - they assign variables 
    - they can not be inherited

- Using the class, create a constructor assigining variables in the car class.
```Java
class Car{
    String model;
    double capacity;
}
```
[Construct](./Construct.java)

- Consider the following table;
     ________________________
    |Item code | Item name  | 
    |    A     | Cooking Fat| 
    |    B     | Maize Flour| 
    |    C     | Sugar      | 
    |    D     | Salt       | 
    |    E     | Bread      | 
    _________________________
 Write a Java Program uaing switch to display Item name when the code is entered and "Unkown Item" when the code doesn't match any of the given ones. 

 [Switch Me](./SwitchMe.java)

- Write a Java program thats sorts an array
 [Sort Me](./SortMe.java)
