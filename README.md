# 100 Days of Code 


## Description

This is a repo of my 100 Days of code daily challenges, lectures and projects.
I started this challenge as a way to increase my consistence in Coding and increase my understanding of certain concepts in Java. 

Not only will I learn Java but also do some other projects in these coming forwad days.

Looking forwad to achieving my goal and dream of being a software engineering.
