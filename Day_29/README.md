# Day 29 of 100 Days of code 

## Objective 1
In this challenge, we test your knowledge of using if-else conditional statements to automate decision-making processes. An if-else statement has the following logical flow:

Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

-If n is odd, print Weird
-If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
-If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
-If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not n is weird.

**Input Format**

A single line containing a positive integer, n.

**Constraints**

- 1 <= n <+ 100

**Output Format**
Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

## Objective 2
In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.
Given an integer, N, print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple  N x i (where 1 <= i <= 10) should be printed on a new line in the form: N x i = result.

**Input Format**

A single integer, N.

**Constraints**

- 2 <= N <= 20

**Output Format**

Print  lines of output; each line  (where1<= i <= 10) contains the of Nx i in the form:
N x i = result.

**Sample Input**
```sh
2
```
**Sample Output**
```sh
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
2 x 6 = 12
2 x 7 = 14
2 x 8 = 16
2 x 9 = 18
2 x 10 = 20

```
