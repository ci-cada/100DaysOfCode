# Day 33.

 Was not feeling well so decided to do some C, Java and Reminded myself of the C++ language after taking a programming break  in Codecademmy on C++ did not do a new concept since I knew I could not get anything from the learning.

**C**
This C code is about recursion to find if a number is prime or not. It was once tested during the ALX SE program and I managed to do it though not so well. In this code I implement a new case where there is a while loop to restrict the number of user inputs so as to allow the code be user interactive. The code Prints _1_ if the number is prime else _0_.
The  expected output;
```sh
1 - is prime so 1
2 - is prime so 1
4 - is not prime so 0
9 - is not prime so 0 
```

 - [C Code](./code.c)

**C Plus Plus**
This C++ will be, since it is a reminder a code to print the grade of the user if one enters the grade. I will implement the if else conditions/ program control to check the user inputs and print the exact correspondig grade
The expexted output of the code is as follows when the user enters a specific number;

```sh

80 - 100 : A
70 - 79  : B 
60 - 69  : C
50 - 59  : D
40 - 49  : Tried
0 - 39   : Super Fail

```
 - [C++ Code](./plus.cpp)

**Python**

This python code utilizes classes, and inheritance to remind me of how they work. The code will be about animals and the first animal will be a mammal with which the other animals will inherit a couple of methods from the Mammal class. The code is expect to encapsulate the mammal class metthods and implement them in the other classes.
The expected output;
```sh
A dog can't cook
A cat can bite
He can cook
```
 - [Python Code](./snake.py)

My day has been succesful a bit since I managed to run a c file and a cpp without google. Really thought I could not do it.
 
Also during this day I managed to set off a new project which will be my final 100DaysOfCode project which will be mostly dwelling on the python programming language or the JavaScript Scripting language based on how efficiently I would have understoood the langguages and their packages all together.

Well tomorrow due to the off weekend streak I will try to learn a few of some JavaScript Concepts and do a litlle bit of python programming.
Might boost my skills more again on Java using some code challenges and hope that I will be able to do some of the previous learnt concepts.


## DONE
