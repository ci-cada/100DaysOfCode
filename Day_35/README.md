# Day  35 of 100 Days of code

## Learning JS
### Conditionals

I did a litlle bit of codes in JavaScript coding on conditionals and later did some tests
[Tests](./exercises.md)

I managed to combine all the conditionals in one code. This will gauge my understanding on writting the code in multiple ways.
