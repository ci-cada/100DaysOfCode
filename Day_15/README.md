# Day 15 of 100 Days of code

Well did not do much of a challenge but just a code in C to sort an array in a specific order.

We was troubled much by the code but finally got a hang of it.

[Sorting Code](./sortme.c)

## Later 

After my coding rendezvous with my friend and that challenge I have been working on a personla chatbot in Py. So decided to read through NLP to perfect my understanding of the Chatbot Making Process.

Did my ALX tasks for today and moving on well. Hope I will graduate soon
