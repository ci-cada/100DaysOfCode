# Day 3 of 100 Days of Code

## Java Programming
In my Java Journey I have managed to understand concepts I thought to be tough during my first encounter with Java. I have gained courage to go through and continue with the language despite the critism it faces as a hard language. 

*recaps*
Previously, I had knowledge in creating a Java file and compiling, writing simple codes, the use of modifiers, private, static and others alike. Package importing and also reading user inputs. 

*Continuing*

### Data Types, Variables, Operators

#### Variables 
This name of a particular memory allocation storing specific type of data. This includes _Number, Name, Quantity_ variables names have specific format of creation ie. *Rules of naming a variable*;
        - Begin with a letter *MUST*
        - It *MUST* not be a keyword 
        - It must be unique,  not the same 

#### Data Types
These determine the values a variable stores, int var will store an integer.

They are of two types primitive Data Types and Reference/ Abstract data types.
 *Primitive*
 They include;
        - Byte of size _-128-127_
        - Short of size _16 bit 2s Complement_
        - int of size _32 bit 2s complement_
        - Long of size _64 bit 2s complemet_
        - float of size _32 bit 2s complement_
        - Double of size _64 bit_
 *Reference/ Abstract*
  Interfaces, classes and arrays. Is a pointer to a memory address in other languages.

#### Operators 
These are symbols that manipulate values. They oprate on values.
They are grouped into;
   - Arithementic Operators
   - Relational and Conditional Operators
   - Shift and Logical Operators 
   - Assignment Operators
   - Others 

   *Arithmetic*
   - _+_ Add 
   - _-_ Subtract 
   - _*_ Multiplication 
   - _/_ Division 
   - _%_ Modulo
        *increment and decrement*
         - _var++_ increments by 1
         - _++var_ increments by 1
         - _var--_ decrements by 1
         - _--var_ decrements by 1
    
    *Relational*
    - _&&_ and operator 
    - _||_ or operator 
    - _!_ not operator 
    - _^_  differnce operator 

    *Shift*
    - _>>_ shift bits right the value to the right of it 
    - _<<_ shifts bits left the value to the right of it 
    - _>>>_ shifts bits right distance the value to the right of it 

    *Assignment*
    - _var1 += var2_    this is equivalent to _var1 = var1 + var2_
    - _var1 -= var2_    this is equivalent to _var1 = var1 - var2_
    - _var1 *= var2_    this is equivalent to _var1 = var1 * var2_
    - _var1 %= var2_    this is equivalent to _var1 = var1 % var2_
    - _var1 &= var2_    this is equivalent to _var1 = var1 & var2_
    - _var1 |= var2_    this is equivalent to _var1 = var1 | var2_
    - _var1 ^= var2_    this is equivalent to _var1 = var1 ^ var2_
    - _var1 <<= var2_   this is equivalent to _var1 = var1 << var2_ 
    - _var1 >>= var2_   this is equivalent to _var1 = var1 >> var2_
    - _var1 >>>= var2_  this is equivalent to _var1 = var1 >>> var2_

    #### Other Supported operators in Java are
    - Ternary Operator _?:_ returns the first expression if the condition met
    - Array operator _type []_ initialized and arrays of specific type 
    - Array Initialization  _type[8]_ creates an array of 8 members 
    - Element access _type[7]_ access the element position 7
    - Reference _._ *op.opp* reference to oop of member op 
    - Method _()_ declares or calls a method
    - Type _(Type)a_ coverts a to the type of type 
    - New operator _new op_ creates a new object or array 

## Python Programming
CS50's David J Malan Object oriented python 2 hour lesson. Only had it for an hour since I understood most of the concepts in object oriented programming using python.
 
I later did HackerRank challenge on Inheritance and Classes. 

Finished my day with some tests on both Java and Python.

   *Tests*

   - [Perform arithmetics in Java](./Rectangle.java)

   - [Python Program showing inheritance](./inherit.py)
