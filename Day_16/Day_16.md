# Day 16 of 100 Days of Code 

## Java Programming 

### Data Structures and Algorithms

This is organizing the data in memory. There are many ways of organizing data in memory.
These are also aset of algorthms that we use in any programming language to structure data in the memory.

To structure a data in memoery a 'n' number of algorithms were proposes which are known as Abstract DAta types. these are sets of rules.

They are of two types.
    - Primitive 
    - Non-Primitive

- Primitive Data Structures are primitive data types. Integer and Characters that can hold a single value
- Non Primitive Data structures are divided into two;
     - linear 
     - Non-linear


Linear are the data arranged in a sequential manner, they are used in Arrays, LinkedLists, Stackes and Queues.

Non linear data where one element is connected to the 'n' number of elements known as a non-linear data structure, these are trees and graphs.

They can aslo be classified as;
- Static Data Structure - Data structure with which the size is allocated at teh compile time. Therefore, the maximum size is fixed.

- Dynamin Data Structure - Data Structure whre size is allocated when the code is running

There are various major operations when it comes to data structure which include;
  - Sorting 
  - Searching 
  - Insertion
  - Updation 
  - Deletion 


Data Structures have its advanatages like;
 - Efficiency - provided one chooses a data structer for implementing a particular Abstract Data Type which is proper the program becomes efficent in terms of space and time.
 - Reusability - The data Structure allows multiple client programs to use.
 - Abstraction - Specific Data Structure by an ADT provides a level of abstraction meaning, the client cannot see what is happening in the code but just focus on the interface.


 ### Data Structures
 - Stacks 
 - Linked Lists 
 - Arrays 
 - Queues
 - Tree
 - Sorting 
 - Graph
 - Search


Going deeper in Data Structures I will beging the algorthms in various languages Py, Java, C to perfect my skills.

This being an introductory of DSA in Java

## Python Programing 

Still reading on the NPL in Chat Bot making. Did simple class codes to help me remember well my Data Structures in Python.
