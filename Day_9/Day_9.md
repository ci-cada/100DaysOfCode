# Day 9 of 100 Days of Code

## Python Coding 

Did not do much on Python just scheemed through Python Tkiter course for GUI development.

Python Object Oriented Programming with CS50's David Malaan.

Finishing the course lecture Today.

*tests*
#### Class Object 
```py
class Parrot:

    # class attribute
    name = ""
    age = 0

# create parrot1 object
parrot1 = Parrot()
parrot1.name = "Blu"
parrot1.age = 10

# create another object parrot2
parrot2 = Parrot()
parrot2.name = "Woo"
parrot2.age = 15

# access attributes
print(f"{parrot1.name} is {parrot1.age} years old")
print(f"{parrot2.name} is {parrot2.age} years old")

```
#### Inheritance 
_This is where a class acquires the characteristics and attributes of another class. A chameleon taking the surfaces color._
```py
# base class
class Animal:
    
    def eat(self):
        print( "I can eat!")
    
    def sleep(self):
        print("I can sleep!")

# derived class
class Dog(Animal):
    
    def bark(self):
        print("I can bark! Woof woof!!")

# Create object of the Dog class
dog1 = Dog()

# Calling members of the base class
dog1.eat()
dog1.sleep()

# Calling member of the derived class
dog1.bark();
```

#### Encapsulation
_This is bunding of attributes and methods inside a single class. Prevents classes from accessing and changing attributes and methods inside a class. Data Hiding_

```py
class Computer:

    def __init__(self):
        self.__maxprice = 900

    def sell(self):
        print("Selling Price: {}".format(self.__maxprice))

    def setMaxPrice(self, price):
        self.__maxprice = price

c = Computer()
c.sell()

# change the price
c.__maxprice = 1000
c.sell()

# using setter function
c.setMaxPrice(1000)
c.sell()
```
#### Polymorphism
_Meaning more than one form of entity(method, operator or object) performing different operations in different scenarios_
```py
class Polygon:
    # method to render a shape
    def render(self):
        print("Rendering Polygon...")

class Square(Polygon):
    # renders Square
    def render(self):
        print("Rendering Square...")

class Circle(Polygon):
    # renders circle
    def render(self):
        print("Rendering Circle...")
    
# create an object of Square
s1 = Square()
s1.render()

# create an object of Circle
c1 = Circle()
c1.render()
```


That was all for today did not do much.
