# Day 38 of 100 Days of code

ALX - After my deferrals my account was recovered and now I am on the third month of alx SE.
So I did discover late about the account recovery so I had myself to the tasks again and again got half of the scores after asking for a new correction. 
It was python and since I was conversant with python I did them almost to completion then J did the C thing in python.
I hope to not differ this time round.

**Elsewhere**
I studied with Jenny in youtube with Jenny's lectures on Python Programming.
Her lectures are comprehensive and short hence they allow one not get tired while learning, not exhaustive.

Learned how to create a ceaser cipher and will update one here soon.
[Ceaser](./ceaser.py)


This was all my day did nothing much apart from ALX that had me worn out with whole lotta of py codes
