Well I did a lil bit of coding in HTML save JS. Took a little in course skimming in JS DOM to allow me do some tasks in JS.


## Java Script Coding 

Skip to day 42. The functions Tasks that I had not managed to finished I managed to update a few tasks. Making me be 7 steps greater in coding JS than I was a few weeks back.

## C Programming 

Looking back C programming, I had a few challenges understanding Structures in C so I went back after successfully understanding Linked lists(Singly) and did some structure learning.

Did a test in Python, say a challenge with one of my peers in ALX to boost our understanding of list comprehension
